# Harvest
A modular grid-based factory/farming game made with vanilla TypeScript and HTML5 canvases

## Features
- Automatical resizing
- Modular levels, sprites and tiles
- Building placement with rotation (took way too long :sob:)

## Known bugs
- Overlays sometimes stay even if their building is removed (only visual)
## Demo
